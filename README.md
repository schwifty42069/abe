Abe - an IRC bot written in nodejs
==================================

This bot is intended to allow users in an IRC channel to create custom commands in multiple languages.

Data for the user created commands are stored in a mongodb instance via RESTful API implemented with the scripts located in the api directory and server.js

The following languages will be available for use:
```
**Python** - (*operational in basic form*)


**Ruby** - *WIP*


**Javascript** - *WIP*


**Bash** - *WIP*


**PHP** - *WIP*

I will update this documentation with more detail as the project comes along!
```
